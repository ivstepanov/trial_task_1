 * particular functionality, but do provide a good example of how to use the
 * FreeRTOS API.
 *
 *
 * In addition to the standard demo tasks, the following tasks and timer are
 * defined and/or created within this file:
 *
 * "Check" software timer - The check timer period is initially set to three

 * the register check tasks, are not only still executing, but are executing
 * without reporting any errors.
